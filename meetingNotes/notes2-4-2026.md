### Training for Simulink

- Implementation will be done in Simulink
- Result will be autocoded to C/C++ and integrated with sensor code
- There is a Simulink STM32F4 toolkit that can be used

### Two phases of landing

- First go right above the landing station, i.e. equidistant from all three landing beacons
    - No altitude change during this phase
    - Manipulate/spoof input distances to effectuate the target landing zone
    - Default landing zone is direct middle of the three beacons
- Then land straight downwards
    - Ensuring that we remain within tolerance in the middle of the beacons
- Two separate control loops
    - Initiate and complete phase one before starting phase two
