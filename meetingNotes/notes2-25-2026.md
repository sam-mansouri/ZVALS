## Key Takeaways

### Phase 2 Demo
- Phase 2 Demo successful
- Drone can fly but is not calibrated
- Simulink model outputs velocities. Controls correctly.
- RF Link is functional

### Controls

- System architecture determined [arch.md](/flightOperation/arch.md)
- Outer loop inner loop link researched [comms.md](/flightOperation/comms.md)

### Drone
- Calibration began
    - Correcting direction of motors
    - Weight will need to be calibrated after all equipment is on board
    - Battery charger is ordered

### RF
- Migrate to microcontrollers
- Migrate to Raspberry Pi 4
- Prepare for integration with Control

## Phase 3 and Final

### Deliverables
- Phase 3 Demo Wednesday 3-11
- Final Report, Poster, and Video due 3-16

### Technical Priorities
- Controls: Calculate pitch, yaw, roll values and migrate to embedded C for STM
- RF: Integrate with Pi, ESP, and send values to Controls
- Drone: calibrate flight dynamics
